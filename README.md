# Causal-Prescriptive-AI-for-Strategic-Business-Decisions
Project concept:

“AI Strategy Advisor” — an intelligent decision engine for business operations.

It identifies cause-effect relationships in company data (e.g., “price drop in Region A → +12% revenue but -8% profit margin”).

It then runs simulations using causal graphs + reinforcement learning to recommend the best actions (pricing, marketing, supply allocation, etc.) to optimize KPIs.

Users can ask:

“What if I increase marketing by 10% in Q3?”
“What’s the optimal promotion budget split to maximize ROI?”

System responds with data-backed causal reasoning and suggestions.

 Tech stack:

ML + Causal AI: DoWhy, CausalNex, EconML

Optimization: Reinforcement Learning (e.g., Stable-Baselines3, Ray RLlib)

Visualization: Streamlit + Plotly or Dash

Data pipeline: Snowflake / BigQuery + Apache Airflow

 Impact:

This takes analytics from insight → decision automation.
Imagine giving business leaders an AI co-strategist that can literally run “what-if” experiments before taking real-world actions.
